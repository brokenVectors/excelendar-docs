# Excelendar's Column management system

Excelendar's column management system is very robust and flexible, allowing for personalization without hiccups. You can rename columns, hide them and move them around without breaking any of the add-in's functionality. If there is an event property that you would like to edit, but doesn't appear in the sheet as a column upon importing, you can add it by ticking its corresponding checkbox in the add-in Settings, and re-importing the calendar.
