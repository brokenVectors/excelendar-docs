# How to import changes from Outlook Calendar into Excel

Once your chosen calendar has been imported into your desired Excel sheet, you can import changes made in Outlook into Excel without re-importing the whole calendar from scratch, which saves a lot of time. Press on the "Import Changes" button in the taskpane to import changes from Outlook. Note that after 3 days of not importing into the sheet, the sync token may expire and Import Changes will treat everything in Outlook as a change, which will be considerably slower than a usual import.
