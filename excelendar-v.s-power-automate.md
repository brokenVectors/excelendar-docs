# Excelendar v.s Power Automate

Microsoft's Power Automate is a powerful tool when it comes to integrating Microsoft apps into eachother. However, in the case of Excel and Outlook Calendar integration, it is very limited.

Here's a side-by-side list of things that Power Automate can do, versus Excelendar:

1. **Speed**: Bulk operations vs individual API calls
2. **Simplicity**: Purpose-built interface vs general automation platform
3. **Excel-native**: Seamless integration with Excel's interface and workflows
4. **Timezone expertise**: Advanced handling for global business users
5. **Column flexibility**: Dynamic data presentation without technical configuration
